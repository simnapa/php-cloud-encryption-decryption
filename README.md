# PHP Cloud Encryption & Decryption System

## Description
A PHP-based application that securely encrypts and decrypts user data before storing and retrieving it from the cloud. The project focuses on data security and confidentiality using encryption techniques.

## Features
- Data encryption before cloud storage
- Secure decryption on retrieval
- Key-based encryption mechanism
- Simple and user-friendly interface

## Technologies Used
- PHP
- MySQL
- HTML, CSS
- Encryption algorithms (AES / OpenSSL / custom logic – edit as per your project)

## How It Works
1. User enters data
2. Data is encrypted using a secret key
3. Encrypted data is stored in the cloud/database
4. Authorized user can decrypt and view original data

## My Role
- Designed encryption and decryption logic
- Implemented PHP backend
- Handled secure data flow
- Tested for data integrity

## Future Improvements
- Role-based access
- Cloud API integration
- Stronger key management
